### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In order to keep the page responsive you should avoid fixed width container, instead you can use percentages.

### Continued development

I want to get back to testing my javascript skills but I won't abandond CSS on the way, as I need to try more flexbox and responsive desgin layouts.
